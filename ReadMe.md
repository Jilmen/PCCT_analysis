This Github repo provides codes used for the analysis of a multimodal image dataset of the wrist.
The dataset consists of 8 speciments, of which the following scans are taken:
- Photon Counting CT (*full wrist + ex vivo*)
- HR-pQCT (*full wrist*)
- micro-CT (*ex vivo*)
- micro-MRI (*full wrist + ex vivo*)

Data is made publicly available via: **link to be added in the near future**
